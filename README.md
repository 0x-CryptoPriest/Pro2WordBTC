all code optimize for threading in any pc and tablet can running with python or python3:


running in windows : `python Pro2WordTrial_c.py` or `python Pro2WordTrial_w.py`


running in Linux (* Debian) : `python3 Pro2WordTrial_c.py` or `python3 Pro2WordTrial_w.py`

There is no difference between these two trial files, only Rich package is used in one of them and not in the other. which depends on the taste of people and users, which one they use. The script in which Rich is used and is colored in the console is called `Pro2WordTrial_c.py`, and the one that is not used and is faster and is simply displayed is `Pro2WordTrial_w.py`.


Trial version screen `Pro2WordTrial_c.py`:
